# Multiplayer Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Using Socket Programming

## Description
This project is a classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors implemented using socket programming and the TCP protocol. Players can connect to a server and compete in real-time matches over a network connection. The game is designed to handle multiple players simultaneously, showcasing the use of network programming and client-server architecture in a multiplayer gaming environment.

## Features
- Real-time multiplayer gameplay over a network.
- Uses TCP protocol for reliable communication between client and server.
- Handles multiple concurrent connections, allowing multiple players to join and play.
- Simple and intuitive game interface.

## How It Works
1. Players connect to the game server using a client application.
2. Once connected, players can challenge each other to a match of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
3. The server handles all communication and game logic, ensuring fair play and synchronizing the game state between players.
4. The result of each match is sent back to the players in real-time.
